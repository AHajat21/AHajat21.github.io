	<p>Welcome to my personal portfolio!</p>

	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>
		17 year old who has just completed A Levels in Maths, Computer Science and Physics.
		I am an aspiring student who has found a new-found passion in web development.
	</p>

	<h2>Digital Skills</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Python and C++</li>
			<li>Game Development skills</li>
			<li>3d Modelling</li>
			<li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Journey</h2>
	<p>
		The journey began with the general exploration of programming languages such as Python, C++, C# and HTML <br /> <br />

		I then explored game development using the Godot game engine, and using a scripting language similar to Python called GDscript. After spending months learning the engine and building test games, I developed my own game over the course of 3 months and released it to itch.io (accessible <a href="https://ahajat21.itch.io/">here</a>). This was at 15 years old. <br /> <br />

		Following this, I learnt 3D Modelling using Blender. <br /> <br />

		During our A Level Computer Science course, we developed a game as part of our NEA coursework. Across 3 months I developed and documented the development of another game, this time using the Unity game engine and the scripting language C#. <br />
		We also learnt the basics of HTML, css and Javascript. <br /> <br />

		This sparked a new passion in me, and as of recently I have further developed my skills in these languages. <br />
		I have created 2 projects using a mix of HTML, css, Javascript. <br /> <br />
