	<h1>My personal portfolio!</h1>

	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>
		18 year old who has just completed A Levels in Maths, Computer Science and Physics and EPQ.
		I am an aspiring student who has a passion for technology and problem-solving. <br /> <br />
		I always find that the best way to learn a skill (for me) is through application. <br />
		So here are some of the projects I consider as 'milestones' throughout my developer journey.
	</p> <br /> <br />

	<h2>Journey</h2>
	<p>
		My developer journey began with the general exploration of programming languages in school/college such as Python, C#, HTML/CSS/JavaScript and SQL <br />
		Curiosity led me to learning C++ and more advanced Python myself at home.
	</p> <br /> <br />

	<h3>Project 1 - Godot Game</h3>
	<p>
		I then explored game development using the Godot game engine, and using a scripting language similar to Python called GDScript. <br />
		After spending months learning the engine and building test games, I developed my own game over the course of 3 months and released it to itch.io.
	</p> <br />
	
	ACCESS IT <a href="https://ahajat21.itch.io/">HERE</a> <br /> <br /> <br />
	<div class="projectInfo">
		This was my first developer experience. It's where I first found the enjoyment in the process of learning new concepts, implementing them and testing. <br />
		More importantly, I learnt the importance of file organisation after my project grew to contain multiple different scripts and scenes <br />
	</div> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />


	<h3>Project 2 - Blender 3D Model</h3>
	Following this, I learnt 3D Modelling using Blender, and made my own version of a popular Blender project: The Blender Donut. <br /> <br />

	</video> <br />
	<div class="projectInfo">
		This project gave me the opportunity to test my creativity. Learning a whole new skill and software like this expanded my problem solving ability and demonstrated my proficiency in different software and digital skills. <br /> <br />
	</div> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />


	<h3>Project 3 - Unity Game</h3>
	<p>
		During our A Level Computer Science course, we developed a game as part of our NEA coursework. Across 4 months I developed and documented the development of another 2d top-down tank shooter game, this time using the Unity game engine and the scripting language C#. <br />
		We also learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br />
		This sparked the passion in me once again, and as of recently I have further developed my skills in these languages. (All the project files from below are accessible from my Github)
	</p> <br /> <br />
	

	<h3>Project 4 - Rock Paper Scissors Game (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)</h3>
	<iframe class="product" src="RockPaperScissors/RPS.html" width="300" height="500"></iframe> <br /> <br />
	<div class="projectInfo">
		I began by following a tutorial for this game before adding basic customisation. <br />
		Although the code used was fairly simple and similar to that of the tutorial, this project was crucial in giving me the opportunity to experiment with these programming languages and making me comfortable with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
	</div> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />


	<h3>Project 5 - Matching Pairs Game (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)</h3>
	<iframe class="product" src="MemoryGame/MG.html" width="400" height="550"></iframe> <br /> <br />
	<div class="projectInfo">
		This project was slightly more difficult and I began working on this project after finding a tutorial for it online. <br />
		Not long after starting however, my algorithmic skills from previous projects kicked in and I found I could complete the rest of the project without using the tutorial. <br />
		While my approach may not have been perfect or the most efficient, it was my first experience of writing a significant amount of code myself in these programming languages. Here, I began understanding the debugging process when logical or syntax errors inevitably arise.
	</div> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />


	<h3>Project 6 - Calculator (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)</h3>
	<iframe class="product" src="CalculatorSite/CS.html" width="500" height="700"></iframe> <br /> <br />
	<div class="projectInfo">
		This project was created with extensive use of all 3 languages, and was created without the use of any tutorial. <br />
		The JavaScript aspect demanded a great amount of logical thinking and validation checks/testing before I was satisfied. <br />
		Styling this page gave me the oppurtunity to learn more about CSS and how it can be used to make a website appealing. I was able to use my creativity to experiment with making the site stand out and look good.
	</div> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />


	<h3>Project 7 - Date Picker (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)</h3>
	<iframe class="product" src="DatePicker/DP.html" width="400" height="450"></iframe> <br /> <br />
	<div class="projectInfo">
		This project was also created without the use of any tutorial.  <br />
		After seeing this idea on <a href="https://roadmap.sh/">Developer Roadmaps</a>, I saw it as an opportunity to further develop my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript - specifically practicing how to style grids in CSS and how to use the "Date()" function appropriately in JavaScript.
	</div> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />


	<h3>Project 8 - Quiz website (full-stack - HTML/CSS/JavaScript, PHP, MySQL</h3>
	<p>
		I am currently working on a full-stack project to test my ability. <br />
		it will include multiple elements: an interface for my quiz game, a good, consistent styling for my website and a relational database with tables for questions, accounts and quiz history. <br />
		For this, I am using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end, PHP for the back-end and MySQL for the database.
		
	</p> <br /> <br />


	<h3>Project 9 - Personal Portfolio (HTML/CSS)</h3>
	<p>
		And lastly, I made the decision to create my own up-to-date portfolio using HTML and CSS<br />
		Despite the fact that using a template would have been significantly easier, faster and better-looking, I felt it to be more authentic and enjoyable to instead utilise the customisability that comes with creating my own.
