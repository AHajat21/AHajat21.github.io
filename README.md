Welcome to my personal portfolio!

## About me
17 year old who has just completed A Levels.
I am an aspiring student who has found a new-found passion in web development.

## Skills

## Journey
The journey began with the general exploration of programming languages such as Python, C++, C# and HTML

I then explored game development using the Godot game engine, and using a scripting language similar to Python called GDscript. After spending months learning the engine and building test games, I developed my own game over the course of 3 months and released it to itch.io (accessible [here](https://ahajat21.itch.io/)). This was at 15 years old.

During our A Level Computer Science course, we developed a game as part of our NEA coursework. Across 3 months I developed and documented the development of another game, this time using the Unity game engine and the scripting language C#.
We also learnt the basics of HTML, css and Javascript.

This sparked a new passion in me, and as of recently I have further developed my skills in these languages.
I have created 2 projects using a mix of HTML, css, Javascript.
